## Abstract

This proposal specifies to increase max contract code size limit to 32KB.

## Rationale

The author proposes raising the limit to 32KB to allow for the deployment of more complex contracts without needing to resort to alternative development patterns.

## Specification

the `MAX_CODE_SIZE` limit set in [EIP-170](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-170.md) changes from `0x6000` (`2**14+2**13`) bytes to `0x8000` (`2**15`) bytes. If contract creation initialization returns data with length of more than `0x8000` bytes, contract creation fails with an out of gas error.

## Security analysis

`MAX_CODE_SIZE` was implemented to mitigate an attack vector where the process of reading code from disk, which has a quadratic complexity of `O(n)`, was being charged a constant amount of gas. However, since this limit was introduced, data fetching has become faster, so raising the limit will not pose a problem.
