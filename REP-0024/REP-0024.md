## Abstract

This proposal specifies to automatically update the staking reward base on the [reward distribution](https://docs.roninchain.com/basics/rewards).

## Rationale

In the current system, staking rewards can only be updated through proposals. When staking rewards is updated, the Governing Validators must approve a proposal. This process introduces operational inefficiencies and may result in reward mismatches due to the uncertainty of the proposal's approval timing. To streamline the process, we propose this REP to automate the updating of staking rewards based on the reward distribution.

## Specification

The first block that distribute the staking rewards is block `start = `[23155200](https://app.roninchain.com/block/23155200). The staking reward every year according to the reward distribution

- From block start to block `start+365*28800*3-1`, the reward per block is `30,000,000/365/28800`.
- From block `start+365*28800*3` to block `start+365*28800*4-1`, the reward per block is `28,000,000/365/28800`.
- From block `start+365*28800*4` to block `start+365*28800*5-1`, the reward per block is `24,000,000/365/28800`.
- From block `start+365*28800*5` to block `start+365*28800*6-1`, the reward per block is `18,000,000/365/28800`.
- From block `start+365*28800*6` to block `start+365*28800*7-1`, the reward per block is `14,000,000/365/28800`.
- From block `start+365*28800*7` to block `start+365*28800*8-1`, the reward per block is `6,000,000/365/28800`.
- After block `start+365*28800*8`, the reward per block is `0`.
