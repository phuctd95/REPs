## Abstract

This proposal specifies the activation of Cancun features on Ronin. 

## Rationale

The process of incorporating changes allows Ronin to introduce new features in Ethereum. With this REP, our intention is to enhance our network by integrating a selection of EIPs.

## Specification

This REP includes the following EIPs:

- [EIP-1153: Transient storage opcodes](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153)
- [EIP-5656: MCOPY - Memory copying instruction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5656)
- [EIP-6780: SELFDESTRUCT only in same transaction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6780) 
- [EIP-4844 - Shard blob transaction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844) 
- [EIP-7516 - BLOBBASEFEE opcode](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7516) 

We make some modifications for EIP-4844 to adapt with Ronin consensus, for further details, refer to [REP-0019](../REP-0019/REP-0019.md).

## Security analysis

The new feature does not affect the security of Ronin.
