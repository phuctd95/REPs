## Abstract

This proposal specifies the activation of Shanghai features on Ronin. 

## Rationale

The process of incorporating changes allows Ronin to introduce new features in Ethereum. With this REP, our intention is to enhance our network by integrating a selection of EIPs.

## Specification

This REP includes the following EIPs:

- [EIP-3651: Starts the COINBASE address warm](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3651)
- [EIP-3855: New PUSH0 instruction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855)
- [EIP-3860: Limit and meter initcode](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860) 


## Security analysis

The new feature does not affect the security of Ronin.
